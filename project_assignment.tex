\begin{abstract}
    This literature review is intended to be a preliminary work for a master thesis.
    The master thesis intends to apply feature-based and model-based time-series clustering techniques on time series data
    extracted from a wind farm in Norway using the platform Kognifai Empower, developed by Kongsberg Digital. 
    The review is written to fulfill the requirements of the course TFE4580. 
    The objectives of the review were to get an overview of machine learning techniques used to monitor wind turbines,
    get an overview of the different feature-based and model-based time-series clustering methods, and determine which
    time-series clustering methods could be relevant for clustering the time series datasets produced by wind turbines in a wind farm.
    96 articles are reviewed for the purpose of fulfilling these objectives. 
    The machine learning methods used for monitoring wind turbines can categorized as regression based models, supervised classification based models
    and unsupervised classification based models. 
    A brief discussion is given of each category, and the machine learning algorithms within each category.
    Many feature-based and model-based representation methods for time-series clustering are discussed, as well as many clustering algorithms. 
    The feature-based representation method of principle component analysis (PCA) is tested for exploring a multivariate time series dataset extracted from a wind farm in Norway.
    Finally the different clustering techniques are discussed, and a choice is made as to which representation methods should be further explored in the master thesis: 
    PCA, and autoregressive moving average models. \medskip
