\chapter{Wind Turbine Monitoring} \label{s:wt_monitoring}
First give a short summary of the spectra of different condition monitoring schemes. Importance of predictive maintainance, and \textbf{short summary} of current implementations of predictive maintainance schemes. 

\section{Wind turbine Components}
Introduce the basic components of a wind turbine, and present some fun statistics about when the different components fail. 


\section{Treating Sensor-data As a Multivariate Time Series}
Here I would introduce the magnitude of the amount of data produced by a single windmill turbine, and illustrate the necessity for tools that can handle this amount of data in real-time. Transition into the new section of clustering of time series.
