@article{wt_bearing_cm_review,
    issn        = {1364-0321},
    abstract    = {<p>Since the early 1980s, wind power technology has experienced an immense growth with respect to both the turbine size and market share. As the demand for large-scale wind turbines and lor operation & maintenance cost continues to raise, the interest on condition monitoring system has increased rapidly. The main components of wind turbines are the focus of all CMS since they frequently cause high repair costs and equipment downtime. However, vast quantities of their failures are caused due to a bearing failure. Therefore, bearing condition monitoring becomes crucial. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review on wind turbine bearing condition monitoring techniques such as acoustic measurement, electrical effects monitoring, power quality, temperature monitoring, wear debris analysis and vibration analysis. Furthermore, this paper will present a literature review and discuss several technical, financial and operational challenges from the purchase of the CMS to the wind farm monitoring stage.</p>},

@article{wt_cm_rev_new_trends_chal_2014,
    issn        = {19961073},
    abstract    = {As the demand for wind energy continues to grow at exponential rates, reducing operation and maintenance (OM) costs and improving reliability have become top priorities in wind turbine (WT) maintenance strategies. In addition to the development of more highly evolved WT designs intended to improve availability, the application of reliable and cost-effective condition-monitoring (CM) techniques offers an efficient approach to achieve this goal. This paper provides a general review and classification of wind turbine condition monitoring (WTCM) methods and techniques with a focus on trends and future challenges. After highlighting the relevant CM, diagnosis, and maintenance analysis, this work outlines the relationship between these concepts and related theories, and examines new trends and future challenges in the WTCM industry. Interesting insights from this research are used to point out strengths and weaknesses in today's WTCM industry and define research priorities needed for the industry to meet the challenges in wind industry technological evolution and market growth.},
