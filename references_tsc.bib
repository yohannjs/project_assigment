    abstract    = {This study introduces a new distance measure for clustering financial time series based on variance ratio test statistics. The proposed metric attempts to assess the level of interdependence of time series from the point of view of return predictability. Simulation results show that this metric aggregates time series according to their serial dependence structure better than a metric based on the sample autocorrelations. An empirical application of this approach to international stock market returns is presented. The results suggest that this metric discriminates stock markets reasonably well according to size and the level of development. Furthermore, despite the substantial evolution of individual variance ratio statistics, the clustering pattern remains fairly stable across different time periods.},

    issn        = {1352-2310},
    abstract    = {Source apportionment studies use prior exploratory methods that are not purpose-oriented and receptor modelling is based on chemical speciation, requiring costly, time-consuming analyses. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are proposed as a routine, exploratory tool to estimate PM10 source contributions. These models were used on annual time series (TS) data from 33 background sites in Spain and Portugal. HMMs enable the creation of groups of PM10 TS observations with similar concentration values, defining the pollutant's regimes of concentration. The results include estimations of source contributions from these regimes, the probability of change among them and their contribution to annual average PM10 concentrations. The annual average Saharan PM10 contribution in the Canary Islands was estimated and compared to other studies. A new procedure for quantifying the wind-blown desert contributions to daily average PM10 concentrations from monitoring sites is proposed. This new procedure seems to correct the net load estimation from deserts achieved with the most frequently used method.},

@article{ghsom_for_finding_optimal_hedge_ratio,

    abstract    = {In this study, a novel procedure combining computational intelligence and statistical methodologies is proposed to improve the accuracy of minimum-variance optimal hedge ratio (OHR) estimation over various hedging horizons. The time series of financial asset returns are clustered hierarchically using a growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) based on the dynamic behaviors of market fluctuation extracted by measurement of variances, covariance, price spread, and their first and second differences. Instead of using original observations, observations with similar patterns in the same cluster and weighted by a resample process are collected to estimate the OHR. Four stock market indexes and related futures contracts, including Taiwan Weighted Index (TWI), Standard $\&$ Poor's 500 Index (S$\&$P 500), Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100), and NIKKEI 255 Index, are adopted in empirical experiments to investigate the correlation between hedging horizon and performance. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve OHR decisions for mid-term and long-term hedging compared with traditional ordinary least squares and naive models.},

@article{topology_for_shape_based_tsc,
    issn        = {0957-4174},
    abstract    = {Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies how objects relate to one another for their qualitative structural properties, such as connectivity and shape. In this paper, we present an approach for data clustering based on topological features computed over the persistence diagram, estimated using the theory of persistent homology. The features indicate topological properties such as Betti numbers, i.e., the number of n-dimensional holes in the discretized data space. The main contribution of our approach is enabling the clustering of time series that have similar recurrent behavior characterized by their attractors in phase space and spatial data that have similar scale-invariant spatial distributions, as traditional clustering techniques ignore that information as they rely on point-to-point dissimilarity measures such as Euclidean distance or elastic measures. We present experiments that confirm the usefulness of our approach with time series and spatial data applications in the fields of biology, medicine and ecology.},

@article{community_detection_networks_tsc,
    issn        = {0020-0255},
    abstract    = {In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering using community detection in complex networks. Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.},

@article{ts_stream_2013,
    issn        = {0925-9902},
    abstract    = {The current ability to produce massive amounts of data and the impossibility in storing it motivated the development of data stream mining strategies. Despite the proposal of many techniques, this research area still lacks in approaches to mine data streams composed of multiple time series, which has applications in finance, medicine and science. Most of the current techniques for clustering streaming time series have a serious limitation in their similarity measure, which are based on the Pearson correlation. In this paper, we show the Pearson correlation is not capable of detecting similarities even for classic time series models, such as those by Box and Jenkins. This limitation motivated our proposal to cluster streaming time series based on their generating functions, which is achieved by considering features obtained using descriptive measures, such as Auto Mutual Information, the Hurst Exponent and several others. We present a new tree-based clustering algorithm, entitled TS-Stream, which uses the extracted features to produce partitions in better accordance to the time series generating functions. Experiments with synthetic data sets confirm TS-Stream outperforms ODAC, currently the most popular technique, in terms of clustering quality. Using real financial time series from the NYSE and NASDAQ, we conducted stock trading simulations employing TS-Stream to support the creation of diversified investment portfolios. Results confirmed TS-Stream increased the monetary returns in several orders of magnitude when compared to trading strategies simply based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence financial indicator.},

    issn        = {1088-467X},
    abstract    = {Time series clustering is a very effective approach in discovering valuable information in various systems such as finance, embedded bio-sensor and genome. However, focusing on the efficiency and scalability of these algorithms to deal with time series data has come at the expense of losing the usability and effectiveness of clustering. In this paper a new multi-step approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of clustering of time series data. In the first step, time series data are clustered approximately. Then, in the second step, the built clusters are split into sub-clusters. Finally, sub-clusters are merged in the third step. In contrast to existing approaches, this method can generate accurate clusters based on similarity in shape in very large time series datasets. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using various published datasets in different domains.},
