    issn        = {1469-7688},
    abstract    = {This study introduces a new distance measure for clustering financial time series based on variance ratio test statistics. The proposed metric attempts to assess the level of interdependence of time series from the point of view of return predictability. Simulation results show that this metric aggregates time series according to their serial dependence structure better than a metric based on the sample autocorrelations. An empirical application of this approach to international stock market returns is presented. The results suggest that this metric discriminates stock markets reasonably well according to size and the level of development. Furthermore, despite the substantial evolution of individual variance ratio statistics, the clustering pattern remains fairly stable across different time periods.},

@article{hmm_pm10_quantifying_impacts,
    issn        = {1352-2310},
    abstract    = {Source apportionment studies use prior exploratory methods that are not purpose-oriented and receptor modelling is based on chemical speciation, requiring costly, time-consuming analyses. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are proposed as a routine, exploratory tool to estimate PM10 source contributions. These models were used on annual time series (TS) data from 33 background sites in Spain and Portugal. HMMs enable the creation of groups of PM10 TS observations with similar concentration values, defining the pollutant's regimes of concentration. The results include estimations of source contributions from these regimes, the probability of change among them and their contribution to annual average PM10 concentrations. The annual average Saharan PM10 contribution in the Canary Islands was estimated and compared to other studies. A new procedure for quantifying the wind-blown desert contributions to daily average PM10 concentrations from monitoring sites is proposed. This new procedure seems to correct the net load estimation from deserts achieved with the most frequently used method.},

@article{ghsom_for_finding_optimal_hedge_ratio,
    issn        = {0925-2312},
    abstract    = {In this study, a novel procedure combining computational intelligence and statistical methodologies is proposed to improve the accuracy of minimum-variance optimal hedge ratio (OHR) estimation over various hedging horizons. The time series of financial asset returns are clustered hierarchically using a growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) based on the dynamic behaviors of market fluctuation extracted by measurement of variances, covariance, price spread, and their first and second differences. Instead of using original observations, observations with similar patterns in the same cluster and weighted by a resample process are collected to estimate the OHR. Four stock market indexes and related futures contracts, including Taiwan Weighted Index (TWI), Standard $\&$ Poor׳s 500 Index (S$\&$P 500), Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100), and NIKKEI 255 Index, are adopted in empirical experiments to investigate the correlation between hedging horizon and performance. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve OHR decisions for mid-term and long-term hedging compared with traditional ordinary least squares and naive models.},
